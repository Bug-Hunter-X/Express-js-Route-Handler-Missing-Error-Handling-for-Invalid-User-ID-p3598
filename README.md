# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling
This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  missing error handling for invalid input. Specifically, the example shows a route that fetches a user by ID but fails to handle cases where the ID is not a valid integer.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file contains a route handler that retrieves a user based on their ID.  However, it doesn't handle potential errors such as the ID being non-numeric or not corresponding to an existing user.  This can lead to unexpected crashes or incorrect responses.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the handler. It includes robust error handling, checking if the ID is a valid number and returning appropriate error responses when necessary.
